This R shiny project uses the cleaned data set from [this Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings)

As per the data set description, the data cleaning removed "entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%)" from the complete data set, also available at the link above.
